                    <p>Simply place a bet and watch it multiply by the second. You may cash out your winnings whenever you want, but beware you could lose it all in a heartbeat if the game goes bust.</p>

                    <p>Founded in 2021 by its founder, JonKali9. Node Buster did not have the funds which other sites had the pleasure of starting with. As the founder created the prototype and began the site with a mere $1,000.</p>

                    <p>In order to make sure that our user base remains manageable, and in order to make sure that we can sufficiently listen to each one of them, Node Buster has decided to adopt an invite only policy. Each month we will be allowing a select number of individuals to join the site and no more. So keep your eyes open and we hope to get in soon.</p>
